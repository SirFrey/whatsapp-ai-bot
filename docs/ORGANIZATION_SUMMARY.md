# ✅ Project Organization Complete

## 🎯 What Was Cleaned Up

### 🗂️ **Directory Structure Reorganized**
- ✅ Created `docs/` for all documentation
- ✅ Created `build/` for user scripts and setup files
- ✅ Organized `scripts/` for advanced development tools
- ✅ Cleaned up root directory clutter

### 📁 **Files Moved to Proper Locations**
```
Before → After
=======   ======
User_Guide.md → docs/User_Guide.md
QUICK_START.md → docs/QUICK_START.md
PACKAGE_README.md → docs/PACKAGE_README.md
AGENTS.md → docs/AGENTS.md
setup.sh → build/setup.sh
setup.bat → build/setup.bat
start.sh → build/start.sh
start.bat → build/start.bat
start-secure.sh → build/start-secure.sh
start-secure.bat → build/start-secure.bat
create-package.sh → build/create-package.sh
```

### 🧹 **Cleaned Up**
- ❌ Removed conflicting package manager files (`package-lock.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, etc.)
- ❌ Removed old disorganized README
- ✅ Fixed file permissions issues
- ✅ Updated .gitignore with proper build directories
- ✅ Standardized on npm as package manager

### 📦 **Updated package.json**
- ✅ Added proper metadata (description, keywords, author, license)
- ✅ Organized scripts logically
- ✅ Added useful commands (`clean`, `package:user`)
- ✅ Removed conflicting or outdated scripts
- ✅ Added engine requirements

### 🔐 **Security & Build System**
- ✅ Obfuscation scripts working (`scripts/obfuscate.mjs`)
- ✅ Secure packaging system (`scripts/create-secure-package.mjs`)
- ✅ User-friendly package creation (`build/create-package.sh`)
- ✅ Cross-platform setup scripts
