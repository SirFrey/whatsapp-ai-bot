# 🔄 Migration from Bun to Node.js Complete

## ✅ Changes Made

### 📦 **package.json Updates**
- ✅ Changed `"start": "bun run src/index.ts"` → `"start": "tsx src/index.ts"`
- ✅ Changed `"dev": "bun run src/index.ts"` → `"dev": "tsx watch src/index.ts"`
- ✅ Added `"dev:watch": "tsx watch src/index.ts"` for clarity
- ✅ Removed `packageManager` field that specified pnpm
- ✅ All scripts now use Node.js ecosystem tools

### 🛠️ **Setup Scripts Updated**

#### **build/setup.sh (Unix)**
- ✅ Removed Bun installation logic
- ✅ Added Node.js version check (requires v18+)
- ✅ Changed `bun install` → `npm install`

#### **build/setup.bat (Windows)**
- ✅ Removed Bun installation requirements
- ✅ Added Node.js version validation
- ✅ Changed `bun install` → `npm install`

### 🚀 **Start Scripts Updated**

#### **build/start.sh (Unix)**
- ✅ Changed `bun run src/index.ts` → `npm start`

#### **build/start.bat (Windows)**
- ✅ Changed `bun run src/index.ts` → `npm start`

### 📁 **Package Creation Script**
- ✅ Updated `build/create-package.sh` to copy `package-lock.json` instead of `bun.lock`

### 📚 **Documentation Updates**
- ✅ Updated `docs/AGENTS.md` to use npm commands
- ✅ Removed Bun references from documentation

### 🧹 **Cleanup**
- ✅ Removed `bun.lock` file
- ✅ Generated proper `package-lock.json` with npm
- ✅ Clean npm install completed successfully

## 🎯 **New Command Structure**

### Development
```bash
npm install          # Install dependencies
npm run dev          # Start development with file watching
npm run build        # Build TypeScript to JavaScript
npm start            # Start the application
```

### User Setup (in distribution)
```bash
./setup.sh           # Install dependencies with npm (Unix)
setup.bat            # Install dependencies with npm (Windows)
./start.sh           # Start with npm start (Unix)
start.bat            # Start with npm start (Windows)
```

### Production & Distribution
```bash
npm run build:obfuscated    # Build with code protection
npm run package:secure      # Create encrypted package
npm run package:user        # Create user distribution
npm run clean              # Clean all build directories
```

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### Runtime Requirements
- **Before**: Bun runtime required
- **After**: Node.js 18+ required (standard and widely available)

### Dependencies
- **tsx**: Used for TypeScript execution in development
- **typescript**: For building production JavaScript
- **npm**: Standard package manager (no special runtime needed)

### Benefits of Migration
1. ✅ **Better Compatibility**: Node.js is more widely available
2. ✅ **Easier Installation**: No need to install additional runtimes
3. ✅ **Standard Tooling**: Uses npm ecosystem everyone knows
4. ✅ **Better Support**: tsx provides excellent TypeScript support
5. ✅ **Deployment Friendly**: Works on any Node.js hosting platform

## 🧪 **Verification**

- ✅ TypeScript build works correctly
- ✅ Package.json scripts are functional
- ✅ Setup scripts detect Node.js properly
- ✅ Start scripts use npm commands
- ✅ Dependencies install cleanly with npm
- ✅ No Bun references remain in active code

## 🚀 **Ready for Use**

The project is now fully migrated to Node.js and ready for:
- Development with `npm run dev`
- Production builds with `npm run build`
- User distribution with Node.js-only requirements
- Deployment on any Node.js environment

**All scripts and processes now use only Node.js and npm!**
